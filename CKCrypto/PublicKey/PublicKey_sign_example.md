## **Usage Example**

### **sign Function**

The `sign` function generates a digital signature for the provided data using the specified signing key type. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the data. The function returns the generated private key (used for signing) and the corresponding public key (used for verification).

Digital signatures are a foundational component of many security protocols. They allow one party to prove that a piece of data was signed by them and hasn't been tampered with.

```swift
public static func sign(data: Data, with signingKeyType: SigningKeyType) -> (privateKey: Data?, publicKey: Data) {
    ...
}
```

**Example using a hypothetical signing key type:**

Suppose you want to sign a piece of data (e.g., a message or transaction):

```swift
let message = "Hello, World!".data(using: .utf8)!
let signingResult = CryptoManager.sign(data: message, with: .Curve25519(algorithm: .SHA256))

// `signingResult.privateKey` contains the private key used for signing.
// `signingResult.publicKey` contains the corresponding public key for verification.
print("Private Key: \(String(describing: signingResult.privateKey))")
print("Public Key: \(signingResult.publicKey)")
```

**Output:**

The output will display the private key used for signing and its corresponding public key:

```
Private Key: <private_key_representation>
Public Key: <public_key_representation>
```

**Explanation:**

In this example, the `sign` function is supplied with a message to sign and a specified signing key type (Curve25519 with SHA256 hashing). The function internally creates a private key and generates a digital signature for the provided message. Along with the signature, the function also provides the corresponding public key, which can be shared openly and used by others to verify the authenticity of the signature.

By sharing the public key and the signed data, others can confirm that the data hasn't been altered since it was signed and that it was signed using the corresponding private key.


Note: Always safeguard private keys. If a malicious actor obtains a private key, they can sign data fraudulently. On the other hand, public keys can be shared openly without compromising security.
